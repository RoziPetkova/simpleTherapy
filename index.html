                    <strong>What is therapy?</strong>
                    <br>
                    Therapy is a combination of methods for treating mental conditions using verbal communication interaction. It has many levels of appliance and is multi flexible meaning that it takes the needs of every single person individually in order to lead to a positive result. In order for the therapy to be effective a person seeking help with their problems must first find the desire in themselves in order to confront his fears, hopes, dreams and what is their desire for a change.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <strong>How exactly does therapy work?</strong>
                    <br>Every solution begins by first admitting that there is a problem. This is a very difficult step but inevitable one. The next step is a desire for a change. Also a very difficult step but with the right guidance nothing is impossible. The third step is very individual since every person requires difference approach towards finding their way to change themselves. But don’t worry we are always here for you.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <strong>How do I know if I am going to experience any change in my life?</strong>
                    <br>That really depends on you. Your expectations, your desires, and your goals will determine how fast and how stable a change can happen. One of the most necessary qualities for a real change is patience. Being patient with yourself will help you accept the obstacle that lies between you and your goal. We can guide you in your journey where your goals are going to be our priority.

            <div class="fadeIn third-text" id="paradigmInfo" STYLE="display:none">At Simple Therapy, we employ a diverse range of therapeutic paradigms to cater to the unique needs of each client. Our approach combines elements from cognitive-behavioral therapy and positive psychotherapy transactional analysis and utilizes projective techniques, ensuring a tailored and individualized approach for every client. This holistic approach allows us to address a wide spectrum of mental health needs, providing comprehensive and personalized care.
                <br><br><strong>Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT)</strong> is thought to be a structured and short-term method that helps clients to become aware of their negative ways of thinking and unhealthy behavioral patterns. CBT is an effective tool and can be used alone or in combination with other therapeutic instruments. It is widely used in treating Anxiety and Depression, eating disorders, PTSD and others. However, CBT is not used only with mental health conditions. It can be a resourceful technique for anyone who wants to learn how to deal with everyday stressful situations, anger management or want to be prepared for challenging situations, to view them more clearly and respond to them in a more effective way.
                <br><br><strong>Positive psychotherapy</strong> is a conflict-centered, integrated, short-term method, created by Nossrat Peseschkian in 1977.
                The term "positive" originates from Latin, signifying the actual and real aspects. <br>This therapy approach is guided by several key principles.
                The "Principle of Hope" is fundamental, aiming to help patients understand the meaning and purpose behind their disorders or conflicts. This involves a positive reinterpretation, where, for example, sleep disturbances may be viewed as heightened alertness or depression as deep emotional responsiveness to conflicts.
                The "Principle of Balance" recognizes universal coping patterns, despite cultural differences. It identifies four life areas - body/health, achievement/work, contact/relationships, and future/purpose/meaning of life - as influential in conflict resolution. However, overemphasizing one area can overshadow the others.
                Lastly, the "Principle of Consultation" outlines a five-stage process for therapy and self-help. It starts with observation and progresses through taking inventory, situational encouragement, verbalization, and expanding goals. This approach empowers patients to resolve issues and set future-oriented life goals by recognizing their strengths and resources. Positive Psychotherapy is a transformative approach that focuses on personal growth and change.

            <div class="fadeIn third-text" id="processInfo" STYLE="display:none">
                The therapeutic journey unfolds through several key sessions.
                <br><br><strong>Initial Session:</strong> This session has multiple purposes. It's primarily dedicated to gathering essential information and establishing the foundation for the shared collaborative work. During this phase, the client's needs, expectations, goals, and motivation for therapy are explored. Additionally, it serves as an opportunity for the therapist and client to become acquainted and determine whether an effective and productive partnership can be established.
                <br>Towards the end of the initial session, the therapist provides a summary, outlining a probable work plan. However, it's essential to recognize that the therapeutic process is dynamic and adaptable. The initial plan we create functions as a flexible guide, open to adjustments throughout the ongoing therapeutic journey. Both the therapist and the client should feel comfortable discussing and modifying this plan as necessary to ensure it remains aligned with your evolving needs and goals.
                <br><br><strong>Second Session:</strong> In this session, our focus remains on gathering valuable information. Furthermore, it aims to educate the client about the structure of our therapeutic sessions. During this phase, you will gain a comprehensive understanding of the session's structure and what to expect during our time together.
                <br><br><strong>Conclusion of Therapy:</strong> It is imperative to prevent therapy from becoming addictive, ensuring that clients do not become overly dependent on the emotional support and acceptance of their therapist. Once the established goals have been met or the needs addressed to satisfaction, the therapeutic process has fulfilled its purpose. Therefore, it should conclude in a healthy and mindful manner.
                <br>As we approach the culmination of our therapeutic work, we gradually reduce the frequency of our sessions. Discussions about closure and any remaining topics you'd like to address are initiated during our final sessions. The conclusion of therapy is a collaborative process, facilitating a smooth transition while respecting your needs and goals.
    
            </div>
            <div class="fadeIn third-text" id="sessionInfo" STYLE="display:none">
                It's important to emphasize that each therapy session is unique, with no strict guidelines. The sessions are tailored to meet the individual requirements and needs of the client. Nevertheless, if we were to delineate a structured framework, it would resemble the following:
                <br><br><strong>Commencement:</strong> Every session begins with a brief five-minute summary of the client's current emotional state, allowing them to introspect and engage with their feelings.
                <br><br><strong>Session Focus:</strong> The session's topic can either align with the initial plan or may address a current issue of higher importance. If the client wishes to discuss an ongoing significant event, this is typically shared at the session's outset. If there are more than one topic for the session, the therapist and the client collaboratively select the session's primary focus.
                <br><br><strong>Core Components:</strong> The essential part of the session comprises dynamic discussions, tailored exercises, or sharing feedback, all adapted to meet the client's unique needs and aspirations.
                <br><br><strong>Closure and Continuation:</strong> Sessions may conclude with specific tasks or follow-up assignments, enabling clients to actively engage with the therapeutic process and apply newfound insights beyond our sessions. While this may initially seem somewhat demanding, it ultimately ensures your robust involvement in therapy and empowers you to implement what you've gleaned during our time together into your daily life. Naturally, these tasks are carefully discussed and not mandatory, if you doesn't feel comfortable doing them.

                            <p>My approach to psychotherapy is characterized by a combination of different therapeutic techniques, including positive therapy, cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), and schema therapy. With a focus on providing online therapy, I have the opportunity to work with clients from various nationalities and cultural backgrounds, offering a diverse and inclusive therapeutic space. One of the core aspects of my approach is my commitment to an individualized therapeutic experience. I firmly believe that each client's journey is unique, and I tailor my interventions and strategies to address their specific needs, strengths, and goals. By building a strong therapeutic alliance based on trust, empathy, and collaboration, I create a safe space for clients to explore their thoughts, emotions, and experiences, allowing for deep self-reflection, insight, and positive change. I specialize in working with mood disorders, such as anxiety and depression, as well as personality disorders, particularly borderline personality disorder. In our sessions with my clients we address a range of topics that are crucial to them well-being, including loneliness and anger management.</p>
